The purpose of the PyBer Analysis is to provide a succinct summary of ride-sharing data by city type (urban, suburban, rural). Using Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib Lirbaries; a collection of summary statistics are computed for the ride-sharing data. Additionally, a multiple line graph chart is added to visualize the average fare by city type.
